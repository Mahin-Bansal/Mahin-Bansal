\section{Question 11(a)}
Given the fourth term of the A.P is 22\\
15th term of A.P. is 66\\
Let first term of A.P. be $a$\\
Let common difference of A.P. be $d$\\
The nth ($a_n$) term  of any Arithmetic progression is given by 
\\$a_n = a +(n-1)d$\\
So,
$a_4$ = $a+3d$ =22\\
$a_15$ = $a+14d$ = 66\\
Subtracting above 2 equations we get,\\
$11d = 44$\\
$d=4$\\
Putting the value of d in $a_4$ equation \\
$a + 3(4) = 22$\\
$a = 10$\\
Hence  1st term of the A.P. is 10 and common difference is 4.\\
Sum of an A.P till n terms is given by $$S_n = (\frac{n}{2}(2a+(n-1)d)$$\\
$$S_8 =\frac{8}{2}(2(10)+(8-1)4$$\\
$$S_8 = 4(20+28)$$\\
$$ S_8 = 192$$\\
